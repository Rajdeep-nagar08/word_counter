A simple console application which reads a text file which can be
piece of a novel, newsletter etc. 
--
Program  is used to read individual words from such files and insert it into a
circular singly linked list, if it is a new word. If that word is already encountered before its
counter must be increased by 1. The list must always be ordered alphabetically. In other
words when inserting the new word, it is also inserted to the right place so alphabetical order
is not broken.
After reading and processing is over, the program gives two options to the user.
a. List the most popular words
b. List total number of words.
c. Print the counter value of a specific word
